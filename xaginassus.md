# Xaginassus

Some few demented summoners have been known to employ the *invocation of the least xaginassus* which will conjure one of these fist sized creatures from a strange dark plane. Least xaginassuses dwell in darkness and feed upon the warmth of the living. They are most commonly placed in packs and satchels to guard against thievery. A xaginassus can be easily taught to recognize the scent of its master and any other hand which reaches into its home will be bitten off.
