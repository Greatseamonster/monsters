# Least Xaginassus

Some few demented summoners, it has been recorded, employ the *Invocation of Least Xaginassus* which will conjure one of these fist-sized creatures from a strange dark plane. Least Xaginassuses dwell contentedly in darkness and feed upon the warmth of the living. They are,therefore, commonly placed in packs or satchels to guard against thievery. A Xaginassus can be easily taught to recognize the scent of its master and any other hand which reaches into its home will be bitten off.
