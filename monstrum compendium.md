# Monsterum Absurdum

being a collection of strange creatures created by magical invocations. 
sometimes by accident and sometimes for a purpose. 

what if each includes where and how to summon one? where they are not an accident. 


[what if the framing conceit for this is that it's a codex of summoning describing various strange creatures that can be summoned as hirelings.]
